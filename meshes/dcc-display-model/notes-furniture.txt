NOTES TO SELF
(or anyone attempting to create new furniture)
----------------------------------------------------------------

use the doll stands as a template when creating new device replace the file
names here with what you are working on.

you need two versions of the device nif. activators will not load skinned versions
properly on cold boot.


doll-stand-a1
--------------------------------

equipable animated object version.

- skin static parts to node fx node 61
- export from max with skyrim default settings. should work in game as is.


doll-stand-a1-static
--------------------------------

1. export from max with skyrim settings: check collision box, uncheck skin modifiers
2. create a primative version that represents collision. this version requires
   no skinning or dismemberment mods. you just want the shapes as a basic nif.
   you can literally just use low poly primative shapes to rough estimate solid parts
   of the final model.
3. use chunkmerge with your final file as the nif-file, your simple nif as the
   collision file, and static.nif (barrel01.nif from vanilla skyrim) to add
   proper collsion data to the file.
4. edit collsion shape material type in nifskope if desired to be relevant.
4. convert NiNode to BSFadeNode in nifskope
5. only check Has Collision in the BSX field.




GAME FORMS
----------------------------------------------------------------

Animation Event and Idle Package.
--------------------------------

use the dm tesvedit script to create these. this should already have been done
really when making just the normal pose for the pose menu.


Animated Equip Object
--------------------------------

copy a working one and name it to match whatever you put in fnis. use the not
static nif. also should have been done already.


MiscObject
--------------------------------

create an object to have in your inventory that is drop and placable of
type MiscObject

1) use crate as the nif for the MiscObject
2) add a texture set to the label of the crate to make it say what it is.
2) add dcc_dm_ObjectDrop script leave properties blank for now.


Activator
--------------------------------

create an object for placable furniture of type Activator.

1) use the static nif as the model.
2) add dcc_dm_ObjectUse script set IdlePackage to the idle package. set
   PickupItem to the MiscObject.
3) collision geometry, show on local map only
4) revisit the MiscObject form script, add the activator as the PlaceItem and
   set Myself to the MiscObject (it needs a self reference, see script
   comments if you need to know)
